     * ====================================
     * When using command line arguments, its important to perform validation to prevent improper usage.
     * In Task 1, check that the number of arguments the user has provided is correct.
     *
     * In C, all command line arguments are provided as strings, but we need our arguments as integers.
     * In Task 2, finish the conversion from strings to unsigned ints using `strtoul().
     * `strtoul` converts a string (str) to (to) an unsigned long (ul).
     * Try `man strtoul` if you want more information about what this function does.
